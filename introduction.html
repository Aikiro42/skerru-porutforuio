		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<p>
			SCALE has been a wild ride for me these past couple years.
			I've made friends, did a lot of stuff, and most importantly, grew up and developed myself to be better.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the most annoying parts of this program is the accomplishment of forms.
			 Form deadlines constantly stressed me out, and getting those papers signed is an arduous task in itself.
			 It annoyed me so much that I was compelled to develop a prototype for a document management system as our research.
		</p>
		<p>
			The most challenging part for me was initiating a leadership activity. I don't easily consider myself fit to be a leader
			 since I'm not even that good of a follower, so I've had a hard time looking for people to take under my wing.
			 Luckily, I've just decided to compete on my last year here in Pisay, and when I joined a group competition (which turned
			 out to be successful and wherein I was the leader) I was able to make it a leadership activity. You may question how I was
			 able to do this, but seriously, it really helped me grow and develop my leadership skills, especially considering the fact that
			 I hardly had any opportunities to properly practice being a leader.
		</p>
		<p>
			I really enjoyed being able to teach one of the things I'm passionate about to my (fellow) students in one activity.
			 I'm sure they learned a lot, and it was a swell thing that I was able to accomplish and wrap up the activity for SCALE.
			 My only regret is that I didn't teach my students fully due to the tons of requirements being stacked upon us by our teachers.
		</p>
		<p>
			I've found out a lot of things about myself during the time I was conducting my SCALE. In these couple years, with the help of forms
			 and teachers, I've been able to appreciate what and who I am better. Suffice to say, SCALE has been a very productive and positive
			 experience for me.
