	<h1>Fitness Program</h1>
	<p>The hardest SCALE activity that I've done. The apps I used to guide me helped, though.</p>
	<p>
	I learned from this activity that emotions, studies and mental stuff could actually affect me do physical stuff.
	 Well, when I first met my ex I was really motivated to make myself look good for her, and was able to lose weight.
	 Then, when stress came my way (from academics and other stuff), I kinda focused on comforting myself more than staying fit.
	 When I broke up with my ex, I really let myself go and gained weight.
	</p>
	<p>
	But now I know that I can lose weight, and I've given myself the mindset that losing fat isn't impossible after all.
	 It just takes time.
	</p>
	<p>
	I have been working out irregularly, so I feel like I have strong abs even though I have a fat belly.
