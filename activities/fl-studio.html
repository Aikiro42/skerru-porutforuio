	<h1>FL STUDIO TUTORIALS</h1>
	<p>Teaching kids has been a wild experience for me.</p>
	<p>I'm especially new to it, and somehow I was able to establish a bond between me and some of my fellow students.
	 It feels fulfilling that I'm able to give them a bit of knowledge that may help them express their creativity.
	</p>
	<p>
	I could say that it was a successful SCALE activity; my only regret is that I wasn't able to extend it more due to the
	 multitude of work we have to do in other academic subjects...
	</p>
