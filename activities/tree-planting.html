	<h1>TREE PLANTING ACTIVITY</h1>
	<p>Oh, one of those memorable moments in my life.</p>
	<p>
	We got up early in the morning to prep water for hydrating the saplings we're going to plant. I remember
	 having a relay line from the second floor of the new boy's dorm to the jeeps on the parking lot near the ASTB.
	 Me, being a lazy, impatient and relatively strong, proceeded to grab a backpack and stuffed litres of water in there
	 (of course, the water was stored in bottles).
	</p>
	<p>
	It was a relatively long journey there, me sitting in the center of the jeep keeping the water bottles from falling out.
	 It may sound arduous in my part but I was actually pretty comfy back then. No aching ass, no awkward seatmates, and the
	 motion of the jeep is just right for my body.
	</p>
	<p>
	When we arrived there I began packing as many litres of water in my backpack as I could. We were all supposed to carry water,
	 and since I was really in the mood that time (the beautiful scenery hyped me up) I decided to hoard many bottles and even carry
	 a gallon with them.
	</p>
	<p>
	The journey to the planting site was traversed by foot; that meant that I carried around 15 kilograms of water with me. It was pretty
	 hard on my back and needless to say, halfway through I needed a bit of help from Sir Cy since I was already lagging behind.
	</p>
	<p>
	We arrived at the planting site, and it was really windy and cool up there, featuring a nice view of the landscape. It was refreshing,
	 getting my hands dirty, learning how to plant trees, basically helping out momma nature.
	</p>
	<p>
	TL;DR: I enjoyed this activity, it was very productive, I had a great time and a good feeling knowing that those trees of ours will grow
	 into oxygen-producing factories that can help the earth in the long run.
	</p>
